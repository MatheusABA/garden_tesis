# Final Project

## Dependencies

To install the requirements.txt dependencies, first create a virtual enviroment to avoid overwriting or incompatiblity
problems, after that, allow the script to be executed on terminal line with `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh` and finally, run it with `./install_dependencies.sh`. By now, you can initialize the server(uvicorn) by typping the exact same command line permission with start_server.sh and then run it.
